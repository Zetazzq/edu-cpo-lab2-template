## Variant 4

### Set based on hash-map, separate chaining

You can use the built-in list for storing buckets and a bucket itself.

You need to check that your implementation correctly works with None value.

## Design notes

- Implementation restrictions:
  - According to my understanding, the key and value of the set should
    be the same value, but still must enter two,otherwise some
    operations cannot be implemented, I don't know how to
    solve this problem.

- Advantages of unittest:
  - Unnitest is more compatible

- Disadvantages of unittest:
  - More limited

## Conclusion

I'm a little rusty with Python, and I'm doing the best I can
